# Python Course for Beginners

- This repo contains under `./lectures/` Jupyter Notebooks in German which follow the chapters 1 to 11 in [1] with some additions here and there taken from [2,3,4].

- The cells are intended as a guide for classroom presentations, and the content alone is not always detailed enough for self-study without supplemental resources.

- The "Slide Types" are adapted to work well with [**RISE**](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a great Jupyter notebook extension which allows you to edit your cells while being in a slide show mode, and is therefore well suited for in-class presentations.

- It was a part in my programming course for first semester students at Trier University. Related repos are:
